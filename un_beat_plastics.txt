Maritime authorities are considering stricter controls on the ocean transport of billions of plastic pellets known as nurdles after a series of spillages around the world. Campaigners warn that nurdles are one of the most common micro-plastic pollutants in the seas, washing up on beaches from New Zealand to Cornwall. The multicoloured pellets produced by petrochemical companies are used as building blocks for plastic products, from bags to bottles and piping. Billions of nurdles washed up in Sri Lanka in May last year after the container ship X-Press Pearl caught fire and sank in the Indian Ocean. The United Nations said the spillage of about 1,680 tonnes of nurdles was the worst maritime disaster in Sri Lanka’s history, with one official saying the spillage was like a “cluster bomb”. The International Maritime Organization, a UN agency, has asked pollution experts to examine the options for “reducing the environmental risk associated with the maritime transport of plastic pellets (nurdles)”. The IMO said a panel of experts would submit their findings for a meeting in April next year. Sri Lanka has called for nurdles transported in container ships to be identified as a harmful substance and a hazard to the marine environment. It would mean tighter procedures to reduce the risk of a spill. In a submission by Sri Lanka to the IMO after the X-Press Pearl sinking, officials said: “The incident has resulted in deaths of marine species such as turtles, whales and dolphins. “There need to be immediate steps taken to regulate and better coordinate the handling, management, and transportation of plastic pellets through the entire supply chain. Voluntary plastic industry initiatives are not sufficient.”
